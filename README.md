# HTTPS-Server

A HTTPS server created using C

Motivations

My goal for this project is the strengthen my knowledge on networking concepts, systems architecture, encryption and security. I also wanted to refresh my understanding of C 

Plan

 I want to create a version using C, without relying too much on other libraries. I aim to get a deep understand of whats under the hood of frameworks like .NET ((i.e. the process of handling raw sockets)).

Steps:

    1. Implment socket basics
    2. HTTP Request
    3. HTTP Response
    4. Static Files
    5. Concurrency
    6. Logging
    7. Encrypted Communication (HTTPS)
